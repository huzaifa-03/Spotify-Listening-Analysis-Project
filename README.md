**Project Overview**

The primary goal of this project is to analyze historical Spotify listening data to uncover significant trends and user preferences. By examining listening habits across different dimensions (albums, artists, tracks, time of day, day of week), we aim to provide valuable insights for improving user engagement and content strategy.

**Data Sources**

The analysis is based on Spotify listening history data, likely provided in CSV format.

1. **_spotify_history.csv_**: Contains raw listening history data.
2. **_spotify_history.xlsx - Sheet1.csv_**: Another version or cleaned subset of the listening history data.
3. **_Spotify_Storytelling_Report_with_Visuals.docx_**: A detailed report summarizing the findings, including visual dashboards.

**Analysis Dashboards**

The project's findings are primarily presented through two main dashboards, as detailed in the Spotify_Storytelling_Report_with_Visuals.docx.

**Dashboard 2: Spotify Listening Behavior – Time & Track Analysis**

This dashboard delves into the temporal aspects of listening and the relationship between track length and frequency.

**Key Findings:**

**Listening Hour & Day Analysis:**

    a. Most Active Listening Hours: Midnight to 6 AM (peak at 12 AM and 1 AM), and again from 4 PM to 11 PM.

    b. Least Active Hours: 9 AM to 1 PM.

    c. Most Active Days: Saturday and Sunday.

    d. Insight: Users prefer night-time listening, suggesting usage for relaxation, sleep, or mood setting.

**Track-Level Listening (Avg Listening Time vs Frequency):**

    a. Most frequently played tracks are under 5 minutes in average duration.

    b. Few tracks with high frequency have an average listening time of ~2–4 minutes.

    c. Long tracks (>10 minutes) are rarely played fully or frequently.

    d. Insight: Shorter tracks drive higher engagement and replays. Users are less likely to complete long tracks.

**Key Takeaways**

a. Downward Trend Post-2021: A clear decline in listening metrics (albums, artists, tracks played) is observed across all categories after 2021.

b. Weekend Dominance: Weekend listening consistently dominates user behavior across all content types.

c. Classic Preferences: Classic rock and iconic artists like The Beatles continue to exert a strong influence on user listening habits.

d. Engagement Drop: The overall drop in engagement post-2021 may signal a need for new content strategies or platform improvements.

e. Night-Time Listening: Users frequently engage with Spotify during late-night and evening hours.

f. Shorter Tracks Perform Better: Tracks under 5 minutes in duration show significantly higher engagement and replay rates.

**Business Recommendations**

Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are proposed:

1. Content Discovery: Implement strategies to push new artist discovery through curated playlists and personalized recommendations.

2. Weekday Engagement: Develop personalized content and campaigns to promote weekday listening.

3. Re-engagement Campaigns: Launch campaigns like 'Flashback Fridays' or 'Your Top Albums' to re-engage dormant users.

4. Churn Investigation: Conduct a thorough investigation into user churn post-2021 to identify and address underlying issues.

5. Night-Themed Playlists: Introduce playlists specifically designed for late-night listeners, aligning with observed peak listening hours.

6. Content Optimization: Optimize content scheduling to align with peak listening times (midnight, evening, weekends).

7. Track Length Promotion: Encourage artists to produce shorter tracks (under 5 minutes) to enhance engagement and replayability.

8. Personalized Playlists: Leverage repeat listening data to power highly personalized 'Top Tracks' playlists for users.
